== About Rabbit

Rabbit is a presentation tool for programmer, especially Rubyist.

Slide is written in text format, so you can use your favorite editor or versioning tool to make it.

Rabbit also has programmer-friendly keybord interface.
You can use Rabbit just as a slide viewer because Rabbit also supports PDF format.
It means even after making slide in other tool like Keynote, you can use Rabbit for displaying it.

You can customize its look with Ruby code, so you can hack even when making slides! 

=== Format

Rabbit supports RD, Wiki markup and Markdown for its format.

((<rd.rd/RD>)) is an abbreviation of Ruby Document, which is
easy to read for its simple text format.

Rabbit supports a ((<hiki.rd/Hiki notation>)); one of
the dialects of Wiki notations.

=== Interface

Rabbit has useful slide operation interface as follows.

  * Keybord interface: If you hit a key, then you will get
    what you want.
  * Mouse gesture: Just for a fun. It'll not be used during
    presentation but it's fun for creating.
  * Hare and tortoise: Visualize remaining time with animation of their race.
